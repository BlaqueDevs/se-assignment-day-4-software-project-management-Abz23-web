ANSWERS
1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Importance: Meeting deadlines is critical for client satisfaction, cost management, and maintaining a market advantage.
Strategies: Set realistic goals, communicate effectively, manage risks, monitor progress, and prioritize tasks.
2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Importance: Effective cost control ensures project profitability and prevents financial losses.
Strategies: Accurate cost estimation, regular monitoring, resource optimization, vendor management, and contingency planning.
3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies.

Agile: Iterative, flexible, adaptable to changes, suitable for uncertain requirements.
Waterfall: Sequential, rigid, less adaptable, suitable for well-defined projects.
4. When to choose Agile or Waterfall?

Agile: Suitable for projects with evolving requirements, rapid prototyping, and collaborative teams.
Waterfall: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, stable environments, and strict deadlines.
5. Quality Assurance Methods:

Testing: Unit, integration, system, acceptance, and security testing.
Code Reviews: Peer reviews for code quality and bug identification.
Static Code Analysis: Automated tools for error detection.
Defect Tracking: Systems to log, track, and resolve defects.
6. Defining Project Scope:

Importance: Clearly defining project boundaries prevents scope creep and ensures focus.
WBS (Work Breakdown Structure): Hierarchical breakdown of tasks to visualize project scope and dependencies.
7. Benefits of Detailed Project Schedule and Gantt Charts:

Visualization: Gantt charts provide a visual representation of project timeline and dependencies.
Planning: Helps in effective planning and resource allocation.
Tracking: Enables tracking progress and identifying potential issues early on.
